          To design a new product or service is always a challenging task. Moreover when it must become an actual breakthrough for actual users and to converge goals from multiple contexts. Innovation techniques has appeared during past years to help on handling such complex scenarios. In particular, Design Thinking has become the most important tool -and a philosophy in some way- for innovation, putting the user in the spotlight of design.

Also, software development methodologies have converged with product development ones in new Lean methodologies and techniques.

The P2Pvalue project has taken both approaches to design and to develop a new Collaborative Platform for Commons-based peer production communities.

During the first year of the P2Pvalue project, these techniques were used in order to discover user needs and to experiment solutions in an agile way, developing and testing prototypes of the platform with users in short cycles. In parallel, technology foundations were put in place with the generalization of the Apache Wave technology.

In this second year, the project has followed the same methodology and techniques to came up with the concept and beta implementation of the P2Pvalue Platform.

In this document, outcomes of the design and implementation of the P2Pvalue platform are introduced and references to produced assets are provided in three categories:

Platform Design: assets regarding the design -ideation and conceptualization- of the platform.

Platform Software: developed software assets comprising the whole P2Pvalue platform.

Platform Infrastructure: resources and assets to support the public service of the P2Pvalue platform on internet as well as the development and coordination with users and stakeholders.

Platform Design

The design of the P2Pvalue platform during the first two years of the project has been based on a large set of research results. Them can be reviewed in following project deliverables:

D1.1 CBPP database.
D1.2 Theoretical synthesis.
D1.3 Guidelines on design settings.
D2.1 Viability of guidelines.
D2.2 Technical features of P2PValue platform (developed in parallel with this work).
D3.2 Report on the Software Foundations: Adaptations, Design & Development.

Starting from these results, additional steps have been performed to come up with the final concept of the P2Pvalue Beta Platform during this second year of work. These steps and the outcomes are introduced below:

Identifying Value Propositions

A value propositions is a feature (or a set of them), solving a specific user need or issue. The identification and design of value propositions is a non formal creative process that takes the results of the user’s research as an input.

In our case the Value Proposition Canvas technique was used. It helps to find out value propositions matching three key elements of a product or service:

User segments:  distribution of participation by groups according to the power law (also known as the 90-9-1 rule).
Customer jobs: identified needs, problems or issues to resolve for each user segment, based on data collected during ethnographic research.
Pains and gains: additional details that a user would like to have or to avoid when she solves the need or problem.

The technique visualises all these elements in a single canvas helping designers to think of solutions to match then.
